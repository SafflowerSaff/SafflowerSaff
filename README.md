- 👋 Hi, I’m @SafflowerSaff, also known as Safiyyah May.
- 👀 I’m interested in building my skills in data science development, and I always have been facinated with tech ethics. More recently I've come across the work of Dr. Casey Fiesler, specifically her work regarding privacy protections.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python with SoloLearn, and I'm excited to begin branching out to other resources and starting my first projects.
- 💞️ I’m looking for mentorship and educational opprotunities.
- 📫 How to reach me: VASafiyyahMay@gmail.com or (574) 303-8494
